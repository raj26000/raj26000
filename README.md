# <p align='center'> Work Samples üõ†Ô∏è </p>
I actively participate in **Kaggle** competitions and open source my notebooks to the community (I'm a Kaggle **Notebooks Expert** too). This is always a tremendous learning curve - both in the techniques involved as well as in documenting and communicating your code effectively, a skill valued immensely at any organisation. Some of my works are linked below, do upvote if you find them useful!
| Project Name      | Description | 
| :---:        |    :----   |  
| [Rider-Driven Cancellation Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raj26000/xgb-optuna-rider-cancellation-prediction)     | Machine Learning model to predict Rider-driven delivery cancellations in advance (i.e. before getting delivered or marked as cancelled), given the details about riders and orders in a structured tabular format. Used the **XGBoost** algorithm to create the model, along with **Optuna** for Hyperparameter tuning. Employed **Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation** to determine the robustness of model on validation data, as well as to make Out-Of-Fold (OOF) predictions on test data.
| [Rider-Driven Cancellation EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raj26000/rider-cancellation-prediction-complete-eda), [Report](https://github.com/raj26000/Python-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Cascade%20Cup%20'22/Round_3_DataAnalysisReport%20(3).pdf)   | Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on the above dataset performed using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Also, created a report explaining the insights derived from the data in detail.
| [Song Popularity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raj26000/xgb-optuna-song-popularity-classification)     | **Binary Classification** task to predict if a song is popular or not based on features like song duration, acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, etc. **EDA** performed in same notebook.|
| [Classifying Effectiveness of Argumentative elements in Student essays - TRAINING](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raj26000/pytorch-feedback-siamese-deberta-base-training)     | Training notebook for classifiying argumentative discourse elements like Lead, Position, Claim, Counterclaim, Evidence, Rebuttal and Conclusion found in student essays into 3 classes - Effective, Adequate and Ineffective. Finetuned the **DeBERTa Transformer** model in **PyTorch** with a **Siamese architecture**, which gave the best results on the Multiclass Logloss metric as compared to standard architectures or other models like RoBERTa. Employed **Gradient Accumulation**, **Mixed Precision Training** and other PyTorch optimizations to deal with GPU memory constraints and **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting.
| [Classifying Effectiveness of Argumentative elements in Student essays - INFERENCE](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raj26000/pytorch-feedback-deberta-base-inference/notebook)     | Inference notebook for the above task. Uses the saved model checkpoint of the best training model to make predictions on test data. 
| [Abstractive Text Summarization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raj26000/abstractive-text-summarization-with-attention)     | Text Summarization task to generate summaries from news articles. Used an **encoder-decoder** architecture of **Bidirectional LSTMs** with a Deep 3-layer stacked encoder in the **Keras** framework. Not the best model in terms of performance, but greatly helped in understanding LSTM architecture and use.
